Destournelles’ sheep.” “Not such a first-rate one, then, for the grey wolf ate up your bait, and then bolted.” “You know why he was not caught, General.” “No, I do not.” “Because it was the black wolf that belonged to old Thibault, the sabot-maker.” “It could not have been Thibault’s black wolf, for you said yourself just this moment that the wolf that used to come and kill M. Destournelles’ sheep was a grey one.” “He is grey now, General; but thirty years ago, when Thibault the sabot-maker was alive, he was black; and, to assure you of the truth of this, look at my hair, which was black as a raven’s thirty years ago, and now is as grey as the Doctor’s.” The Doctor was a cat, an animal of some fame, that you will find mentioned in my _Mémoires_ and known as the Doctor on account of the magnificent fur which nature had given it for a coat.

Bitterness in his heavy-clouded eyes, Bitterness as of heaven's intestine wars Brooded; he looked upon the unfathomed skies And whispered--to the stars-- Some day, he said, she will forget all this That she calls life, and looking far above See throned among the great eternities This dream of mine, this love; Love that has given my soul these wings of fire To beat in glory above the sapphire sea, Until the wings of the infinite desire Close in infinity; Love that has taken the glory of hawthorn boughs, And all the dreaming beauty of hazel skies, As ministers to the radiance of her brows And haunted April eyes; Love that is hidden so deep beneath the dust Of little daily duties and delights, Till that reproachful face of hers grows just And God at last requites A soul whose dream was deeper than the skies, A heart whose hope was wider than the sea, Yet could not enter through his true love's eyes Their grey infinity.
