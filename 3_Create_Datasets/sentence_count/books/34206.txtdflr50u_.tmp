The present edition is an exact reproduction of that edited by my
father, with my great-uncle's final corrections, and published by Mr.
John Murray in 1859. Several reprints of that edition have testified to
the continued popularity of the work, and the necessity for the present
issue shows that an acquaintance of nearly half a century has not yet
wearied the public of the standard translation of the _Thousand and One
Nights_. The secret of Mr. Lane's success is to be found partly in the
instinctive sympathy for the spirit of the East, which enabled him
faithfully to reproduce the characteristic tone of the original, and
partly in the rich store of illustrations of oriental life and thought
contained in his Notes. In the various cheap versions, based upon
Galland's French paraphrase, the Eastern tone and local colour is wholly
wanting; and the peculiarities of life and manners, which contrast so
markedly with those of the West, are left unnoted and unexplained. Such
versions may serve in an inadequate degree to make the Arabian Nights
known to those who care only for the bare stories; but educated readers,
who are capable of something more than the mere enjoyment of the
romance, and desire to understand the character and habits of the actors
and the spectators, find in Mr. Lane's translation, and in his only, a
complete satisfaction of their want. It is not merely a scholar's
edition, though no oriental student can afford to be without it; but
beyond this narrow circle it has ever appealed to the wide audience that
cares to know the famous books of the world in their most perfect and
faithful reflections.

The actual moment is an opportune one for the reappearance of the work.
Egypt just now holds a foremost place in the eyes of the world, and it
is of Egypt that the _Thousand and One Nights_ have most to tell. Indian
or Persian as many of the tales are in their origin, their setting is
almost purely Egyptian; and though the place may be nominally Baghdad or
India, or even furthest China, it is in mediaeval Cairo, in the days of
the Memlooks, that the scene of the Arabian Nights is really laid. The
people described are not Hindoos or Chinese, but Arabs and Egyptians as
they lived and moved in the fifteenth century, when some of the
beautiful mosques and tombs, that still make Cairo the delight of
artists, were being built, and the devastating hand of the Ottoman Turk
had not yet been laid on the land of the Pharaohs. For a minute picture
of Arabian society as it was in the Middle Ages, the _Thousand and One
Nights_ have no rival, and it is Mr. Lane's appreciation of this
picture, and the wealth of illustration lavished upon it in his Notes,
that render his edition the most complete commentary we possess on
Muslim life and manners, religion and literature, and make it an
indispensable supplement to his famous _Account of the Manners and
Customs of the Modern Egyptians_. The poetry of Eastern life is rapidly
fading away under the effacing touch of European civilisation; the
characteristic society in which an Haroon-Er-Rasheed, an Aboo-Nuwas, a
Kafoor, a Saladin, or a Kait-Bey, revelled and jested and conquered, is
fast becoming matter of history rather than of experience, a field for
the antiquary instead of the traveller; and it is well that we can
reconstruct it in the pages of the _Thousand and One Nights_, whose
compiler saw it when it was still almost in its Golden Prime, and in the
_Modern Egyptians_, whose author knew it when it still preserved the
romantic character which has charmed and fascinated readers of every age
and condition.

THE EDITOR'S PREFACE.


A new edition of this work having been required, Mr. Lane was requested
to undertake the correction of the press. But severe literary labours
allowing him no leisure for this object, he named me, as his pupil in
the study of Arabic, familiar with his writings, and for many years
resident with him in Cairo, to fill, in some measure, his place. I have
undertaken this duty with great diffidence, from a sense of my own
deficiencies and his extensive knowledge; but I have felt that I could
at least insure the correctness of the text, and a scrupulous adherence
to his wishes. The present edition is printed, without any variations of
my own (except those which are marked as such, and have been submitted
to Mr. Lane), from a copy of the first and complete edition, with
corrections and additions made by Mr. Lane, from time to time, since its
first publication. These, however, from the accuracy with which the
translation was made, and the fulness of the Notes, are not very
numerous. The same reasons have also caused my own notes to be few: I
believe that my Uncle's notes are complete in themselves; and that I
have sometimes erred, even in the rare exceptions I have made, on the
side of unnecessary addition.

An edition of any book not superintended by the author is sometimes
regarded with distrust. I would therefore assure the reader that in this
instance he may depend even on the punctuation; the whole having been
laboriously collated with Mr. Lane's annotated copy, notwithstanding the
great delay which this process has occasioned in the printing of the
work.

I have called this a _complete_ edition, to distinguish it from two
others which have been published without Mr. Lane's notes or his method
of writing oriental words, and with other variations from the standard
edition. The public appreciation of these notes, and of the advantage of
correctly-written foreign words, is, I conceive, proved by the call for
the present edition. On the subject of the mode of writing oriental
words in European characters, I need say little, for the controversy has
well nigh died out. The present generation does not regard antiquated
blunders as "the familiar names of childhood," but rather strives to
attain accuracy in all things; and those few who still cling to
"Mahomet" or "Mahomed" should consistently exhume the forgotten
"Mahound" of the Crusades.

The translator's views respecting the origin and literary history of
"The Thousand and One Nights" will be found fully expressed in the
Review at the end of the third volume. In his original preface, he
stated, "The remarks which I here submit to the reader, being written
when only one-third of the work to which they principally relate is
printed, must unavoidably be more defective than they would be if
reserved until a later period. During the progress of the publication I
may be enabled to form clearer and more complete views of the several
subjects which might with propriety be fully discussed at the head of
my translation, and I think it better, therefore, to append at the close
of the work many observations which I originally intended to prefix to
the first volume." He has therefore wished me to remodel the preface,
transferring all portions relating to the subjects in question to the
Review, retaining whatever may more properly stand at the commencement
of the work, and adding any matter of my own.

The object with which the translation was made is best expressed in the
words of Mr. Lane's preface.

"My undertaking to translate anew the Tales of 'The Thousand and One
Nights' implies an unfavourable opinion of the version which has so long
amused us; but I must express my objections with respect to the latter
in plain terms, and this I shall do by means of a few words on the
version of Galland, from which it is derived; for to him alone its chief
faults are to be attributed. I am somewhat reluctant to make this
remark, because several persons, and among them some of high and
deserved reputation as Arabic scholars, have pronounced an opinion that
his version is an _improvement_ upon the original. That 'The Thousand
and One Nights' may be greatly improved, I most readily admit; but as
confidently do I assert that Galland has excessively _perverted_ the
work. His acquaintance with Arab manners and customs was insufficient to
preserve him always from errors of the grossest description, and by the
_style_ of his version he has given to the whole a false character, thus
sacrificing, in a great measure, what is most valuable in the original
work,--I mean its minute accuracy with respect to those peculiarities
which distinguish the Arabs from every other nation, not only of the
West, but also of the East. Deceived by the vague nature of Galland's
version, travellers in Persia, Turkey, and India, have often fancied
that the Arabian Tales describe the particular manners of the natives of
those countries; but no one who has read them in the original language,
having an intimate acquaintance with the Arabs, can be of this opinion:
it is in Arabian countries, and especially in Egypt, that we see the
people, the dresses, and the buildings, which it describes in almost
every case, even when the scene is laid in Persia, in India, or in
China.

"Convinced of the truth of this assertion, I consider myself possessed
of the chief qualifications for the proper accomplishment of my present
undertaking, from my having lived several years in Cairo, associating
almost exclusively with Arabs, speaking their language, conforming to
their general habits with the most scrupulous exactitude, and received
into their society on terms of perfect equality. Since the downfall of
the Arab Empire of Baghdad, Cairo has been the chief of Arabian cities:
its Memlook Sul[t.]ans, introduced into Egypt in their youth, naturally
adopted, to a great degree, the manners of its native inhabitants, which
the 'Osmanlee Turks in later days have but little altered. Cairo is the
city in which Arabian manners now exist in the most refined state; and
such I believe to have been the case when the present work was
composed."

Mr. Lane's first two visits to Egypt were made when, for the last time,
Arab manners and customs as they existed in the age of the Arabian
Nights could be studied; and his translation was written very shortly
after his second return to England. Though some of the tales may be
Indian or Persian in origin, in their present state they exhibit a
picture of the manners, modes of thought, and language, of the court and
times of the Memlook Sul[t.]ans of Egypt, which nearly resembled in
these points those of the Khaleefehs of Baghdad, or the great Arab
Empire. De Sacy and Von Hammer, the two celebrated orientalists who
differed widely in opinion as to the origin of the book, agreed that the
tales in which the Khaleefeh Haroon Er-Rasheed is introduced (the best,
with few exceptions, in the collection) are Egyptian in character. But
since the "Modern Egyptians" were described by Mr. Lane, all things in
the East have changed, and every day witnesses the decay of some old
custom, to be followed by a bastard European imitation. During Mohammad
'Alee's rule, all traces of the state and circumstance of the Memlook
court gradually passed away. European dress has displaced oriental
costume, cloth of gold, and dresses of honour; European architecture
elbows the quaint beauty of the old Arab capital; and the cavalcade of
fifty horsemen around a grandee is succeeded by an English carriage that
profanes the quiet streets of the city, and frightens away both 'Efreets
and their memory. Mr. Lane saw the last of Cairo in its integrity; and
he has not overstated his qualifications, as author of the "Modern
Egyptians," for the task of translating the Arabian Nights.

Of the copy from which this translation was made, and the method
observed in its execution, I may again quote the preface to the first
edition. Mr. Lane says,--

"I have taken as my general standard of the original text the Cairo
edition lately printed; it being greatly superior to the other printed
editions, and probably to every manuscript copy.[1] It appears to agree
almost exactly with the celebrated MS. of Von Hammer, than which no copy
more copious, I believe, exists; and contains all the tales in the old
version except those which, as Von Hammer says, Galland appears to have
taken from other works, Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, in the Royal
Library of Paris. The manuscript from which it was printed was carefully
collated and corrected by a very learned man, the sheykh
'Abd-Er-Ra[h.]man E[s.]-[S.]aftee Esh-Shar[k.]awee, who also
superintended the progress of the work through the press. But in
addition to the value conferred upon it by the corrections of this
sheykh, the copy from which the whole of my translation is made, except
in a few instances, possesses an advantage which, I believe, renders it
incomparably superior to any other now existing: it has been again
revised and corrected, and illustrated with numerous manuscript notes,
by a person whom I think I may safely pronounce the first philologist of
the first Arab college of the present day, the sheykh Mo[h.]ammad 'Eiyad
E[t.]-[T.]an[t.]awee, or, more properly, E[t.]-[T.]anditaee. His notes
are chiefly philological, and explanatory of words which do not belong
to the classical language; and many of them are of very great assistance
to me; though most of them I find unnecessary, from the knowledge of the
modern Arabic which I have acquired during my intercourse with the
people who speak it. His corrections of the text are numerous; and as
they would interest very few persons, I have mentioned but few of them
in the notes to my translation, notwithstanding a strong temptation that
I felt to do otherwise in order that Arabic scholars might be assisted
to judge of the fidelity of my version by comparing it with the text of
the Cairo edition.[2] To the pieces of poetry which are interspersed
throughout the work he has paid especial attention; not only correcting
the errors which he found in them, but also always adding the
vowel-points, and generally, commentaries or explanations. Thus I have
shewn that I am very greatly indebted to him for his learned labours. I
should, however, add, that I have ventured to differ from him in
interpreting a few words; having found more appropriate meanings
assigned to them by Arabs in parts not visited by him, or such meanings
given in printed dictionaries with which he is unacquainted; and I have
also corrected a few errors which have escaped his notice.[3] Without
the valuable aid which he has afforded me, I would not have attempted
the translation; nor with it would I have done so were it not for the
advantage that I derive from my having lived among Arabs. No translator
can always be certain that, from twenty or more significations which are
borne by one Arabic word, he has selected that which his author intended
to convey; but, circumstanced as I am, I have the satisfaction of
feeling confident that I have never given, to a word or phrase in this
work, a meaning which is inconsistent with its presenting faithful
pictures of Arab life and manners.

"I have thought it right to omit such tales, anecdotes, &c., as are
comparatively uninteresting or on any account objectionable. In other
words, I insert nothing that I deem greatly inferior in interest to the
tales in the old version. Certain passages which, in the original work,
are of an objectionable nature, I have slightly varied; but in doing
this, I have been particularly careful to render them so as to be
perfectly agreeable with Arab manners and customs. It was originally my
intention to omit almost the whole of the poetry, thinking that the loss
of measure and rhyme, and the impossibility of preserving the examples
of paronomasia and some other figures with which they abound, would
render translations of them generally intolerable to the reader: but
afterwards I reflected that the character of the work would be thus
greatly altered; and its value, as illustrating Arab manners and
feelings, much diminished. I therefore determined to preserve a
considerable number of select pieces, chosen either for their relative
merits or because required by the context. The number of those comprised
in the first volume of my translation is nearly half of the number
contained in the corresponding portion of the original work; but in
several cases I have omitted one or more verses of a piece as
unsuitable, or for some other reason; and in a few instances I have
given only the first verse or the first couplet. These pieces of poetry
are not in general to be regarded as the compositions of the author or
authors of the work: they appear to be mostly borrowed from others, and
many of them are taken from the works of celebrated poets.--To avoid the
tedious interruptions which occur in the original at the close of each
Night, I have divided the translation into chapters, each of which
consists of one tale, or of two or more tales connected one with
another, and have merely mentioned the Night with which each chapter
commences, and that with which it terminates.

"The original work being designed solely for the entertainment of Arabs,
I add copious notes to the translation, to render it more intelligible
and agreeable to the English reader. These are entirely my own, except
in those cases when I have stated otherwise;[4] and my general object in
them has been to give such illustrations as may satisfy the general
reader, without obliging him to consult other works. In many of them I
endeavour to shew, by extracts from esteemed Arabic histories and
scientific and other writings, chiefly drawn from MSS. in my possession,
as well as by assertions and anecdotes that I have heard, and conduct
that I have witnessed, during my intercourse with Arabs, that the most
extravagant relations in this work are not in general regarded, even by
the educated classes of that people, as of an incredible nature. This is
a point which I deem of much importance to set the work in its proper
light before my countrymen. I have resided in a land where genii are
still firmly believed to obey the summons of the magician or the owner
of a talisman, and to act in occurrences of every day; and I have
listened to stories of their deeds related as facts by persons of the
highest respectability, and by some who would not condescend to read the
tales of 'The Thousand and One Nights,' merely because they are
fictions, and not written in the usual polished style of literary
compositions."

I have already mentioned that the literary history of "The Thousand and
One Nights" is discussed in Mr. Lane's Review appended to this
translation. In the course of my Arabic studies, and more especially
since I have been occupied in editing the present work, I have
endeavoured to form an unbiassed judgment on this difficult question;
and all my researches have confirmed me in agreeing with the opinions
there expressed. Von Hammer was inclined to lay too much stress on the
supposed Persian or Indian origin of these Tales; while De Sacy, on the
other hand, rejected the belief in any connection between the old work
and the more modern; contending that the latter was an independent
production. The discovery, however, of a passage in an Arabic author, by
Von Hammer, since the publication of De Sacy's Essay and Mr. Lane's
Preface, has placed the matter beyond a doubt; and scholars are now
agreed, notwithstanding De Sacy's pleasant sarcasm, and the weight of
his great name, that "The Thousand Nights" formed in some measure the
prototype of "The Thousand and One Nights." On the other hand, De Sacy's
keen appreciation of the modern (and chiefly Egyptian, or Arab,)
character of the book, in its present form, must be fully recognised,
and was indeed thus acknowledged by Von Hammer himself. The manners,
dresses, and modes of thought, portrayed by it are Arab throughout, even
in the stories which are probably retained from the Persian or Indian
original, of which that of the Magic Horse is the best example in this
translation. Besides those relating to the court and adventures of
Haroon Er-Rasheed, which, as I have before remarked, are curiously
Egyptian, many others appear to have been remodelled, if not actually
composed, in Egypt. It is not less true that these tales are generally
the best in the collection, if those of the Slave Kafoor, of 'Azeez and
'Azeezeh, and of Es-Sindibad, be excepted; for these certainly are
inferior to none. The more colloquial and familiar stories point to the
same origin; such as that of 'Ala-ed-Deen Abu-sh-Shamat (which is
pervaded by Egyptian characteristics in phraseology and in other
respects), that of Aboo-[S.]eer and Aboo-[K.]eer, and that of
Ma[a.]roof. The stories founded mainly on Persian or Indian originals
appear to be those in which supernatural beings play the most
conspicuous parts; and, as Mr. Lane remarks, these are generally
deficient in verses, although the converse does not hold good of the
former class. The anecdotes are mostly historical: many of them are, in
the Notes, identified with similar ones in other Arabic works; and
almost all are of Arab origin.

The evidences of a late date scattered through the book may be additions
of copyists and reciters; but considered with reference to its general
character, they have a certain weight that cannot be overlooked: this is
carefully stated in the Review.

Mr. Lane's arguments in favour of the collective "Thousand and One
Nights" being an individual work, and not one of many similar
collections, seem to me to be conclusive: not the least important of
these is the fact that no similar collection is known to exist, nor is
mentioned by any Arab author, with the sole exception of the old
"Thousand Nights," which I believe he has demonstrated to be the
prototype, in a remote degree, of the "Thousand and One." To cite the
words of the Preface on the question of the original of the work as it
is known to us--"I have shewn it to be my opinion that all the complete
copies of 'The Thousand and One Nights' now known are in the main
derived, though not immediately, from one original; and I hold the same
opinion with respect to every fragment containing the commencement of
the work;" "not regarding the work as wholly original, nor as the first
of its kind; for many of the tales which it contains are doubtless of
different and early origins; and I think that its general plan is
probably borrowed from a much older production, bearing the same title
of 'The Thousand and One Nights,' [or 'The Thousand Nights,'] a
translation of a Persian work having a corresponding title, namely
'Hezar Afsaneh.'... One thing is certain--that 'The Thousand and One
Nights,' [or 'The Thousand Nights,'] translated from the Persian was
much older than the work now known by that title, and also extremely
different from the latter."

When these facts are considered in reference to each other, the date
assigned, in the Review, to the composition of the work cannot
reasonably be regarded as far from the truth. It is in Egypt, and
especially in the Memlook court, that we must look to find the people,
the manners, and the habits of thought, of "The Arabian Nights;" while
the style of the language in which they are written is that which we
might expect from an Egyptian of those times, who, unskilled in the
classical Arabic, yet endeavouring to imitate it, was doubtless more
generally intelligible then than he is now to the modern Egyptians. This
assumption of the old language, I may remark, is, and always has been,
characteristic of all learned Arabs, be they Egyptians or natives of
other Arabian countries (for such Egypt truly is); but no other instance
exists of a work of fiction in which the attempt fails so singularly in
affecting the classical, or retaining the modern tongue; while all other
Arabic _tales_ are certainly composed in either the one or the other.
The modern Egyptian romances are mostly written in the colloquial
dialect of every-day life; but those which are of older date are not
_modernized_, as some have supposed, against all reason, "The Thousand
and One Nights" to be: such an alteration would be without a parallel in
Arabic literature, as Mr. Lane proves in the Review in a way to relieve
me of the necessity of further alluding here to this particular
question. "The Thousand and One Nights" exhibit a style which would be
unfamiliar to the audience of the reciter of romances, without attaining
to the classical diction: and the conclusion is forced on us that the
work exhibits the language of a by-gone generation, which (taking into
consideration the other indications of its age and country), is, it can
scarcely be disputed, that of the later period of the Memlook rulers of
Egypt, before the Turkish conquest of that country. In the words of Mr.
Lane's Preface:--"Most of the tales which it contains are doubtless of
an older _origin_, and many of them founded upon very old traditions and
legends; but all these traditions or legends were evidently remodelled
so as to become pictures of the state of manners which existed among the
Arabs, and especially among those of Egypt, at the period here
mentioned; and I think that the composer of the work, or each of the
composers, if one commenced and another completed it, was an Egyptian."

But a more popular subject than its obscure origin is the literary merit
of this work. The rare fascination of these old Arab stories, their
supernatural romance, excessive love, quaint philosophy, and grotesque
humour, have, since the days of Galland, secured to them more readers
than any other profane work. The translation of Galland, with all its
lameness, puerility, and indecency, gained for them a hold which has
never been relaxed; and it only required the appearance of a scholarlike
and readable translation, freed from these defects, to make them
generally accepted in English families. The fashion of travelling in the
East has not a little added to the desire for a standard and annotated
edition of a work unique, even in those lands of genii and adventure, in
its remarkable portrayal of Eastern character, life, and, when closely
translated, idiom. The humour of the book, now broad, now subtle, (who
does not delight in Kafoor and his "half lie?") renders the comic
stories generally superior to the romantic; but the pathos perhaps
excels every other beauty. The story of Shems-en-Nahar is remarkable for
this characteristic; and that of 'Azeez and 'Azeezeh (first published in
this translation), surpasses in delicate tenderness any Arab tale with
which we are acquainted.

Of the critical value of Mr. Lane's translation I ought scarcely to
speak. Yet I may observe that students of Arabic make it a text-book in
reading the original; while the English reader not uncommonly forgets
that it is a translation, and detects not the literal accuracy of its
rendering of an unfamiliar, or unknown, language.

I have adverted to the system adopted in transcribing foreign words, and
I now conclude these preliminary remarks (intended only to render the
learned Review easier of perusal to the general reader, and to smooth
his first steps in a strange land), by quoting, with some slight
improvements by Mr. Lane, the explanation of that system given in the
preface to the first edition.

"In writing Arabic and other Oriental words in the present work, I have
employed a system congenial with our language, and of the most simple
kind; and to this system I adhere in every case, for the sake of
uniformity as well as _truth_.[5] Some persons have objected to my
writing in this manner a few familiar words which are found in our
dictionaries; but they will excuse me for remarking that general usage
is not altogether accordant with their opinion. Almost every author, I
believe, now writes 'Koran,' or 'Kuran,' and 'Pasha,' or 'Pacha,' for
our dictionary-words 'Alcoran' and 'Bashaw;' and most of our best
authors on Arabian History, of late, have written 'Khalif' for 'Caliph.'
In a work relating to a people who pronounce the Arabic w as v, I should
write 'Vezeer' for the Arabic word 'Wezeer;' but to do so when the
subject is Arabian, I consider inexpedient: and in this opinion I am
upheld by a great majority of literary and other friends whom I have
consulted on the subject, in the proportion of five to one. I may add
that Dr. Johnson has written in his Dictionary, 'Vizier [properly
_Wazir_];' and if we express the Arabic vowels by their _Italian_
equivalents, it _is_ properly 'Wazir' or 'Wezir.'--The system which I
here employ requires but little explanation; the general reader may be
directed to pronounce

  a as in our word 'beggar:'[6]
  a as in 'father:'[7]
  e as in 'bed:'
  e as in 'there:'
  ee as in 'bee:'
  ei as our word 'eye:'
  ey as in 'they:'
  i as in 'bid:'
  o as in 'obey' (short):
  o as in 'bone:'
  oo as in 'boot:'
  ow as in 'down:'
           and
  u as in 'bull.'

  The letter y is to be pronounced as in 'you' and 'lawyer:' never as
    in 'by.'

  An _apostrophe_, when immediately preceding or following a vowel, I
    employ to denote the place of a letter which has no equivalent in
    our alphabet; it has a guttural sound like that which is heard in
    the bleating of sheep: [a.] (with a dot beneath) represents the same
    sound at the end of a syllable, when it is more forcibly pronounced.

  Each of the consonants distinguished by a dot beneath has a
    peculiarly hard sound.

  Having avoided as much as possible making use of accents, I must
    request the reader to bear in mind that a single vowel, when not
    marked with an accent, is always short; and that a double vowel or
    diphthong at the end of a word, when not so marked, is not accented
    ('Welee,' for instance, being pronounced 'W[)e]'lee'): also, that
    the acute accent does not always denote the principal or only
    emphasis ('Haroon' being pronounced 'Haroon'); that a vowel with a
    grave accent (only occurring at the end of a word), is not
    emphasized, though it is long; and that dh, gh, kh, sh, and th, when
    not divided by a hyphen, represent, each, a single Arabic
    letter."[8]

I have only to add one more extract from Mr. Lane's Preface.


"Many of the engravings which are so numerously interspersed in this
work will considerably assist to explain both the Text and the Notes;
and to insure their accuracy, to the utmost of my ability, I have
supplied the artist with modern dresses, and with other requisite
materials. Thus he has been enabled to make his designs agree more
nearly with the costumes &c. of the times which the tales generally
illustrate than they would if he trusted alone to the imperfect
descriptions which I have found in Arabic works.[9] Except in a few
cases, when I had given him such directions as I deemed necessary, his
original designs have been submitted to me; and in suggesting any
corrections, I have, as much as possible, avoided fettering his
imagination, which needs no eulogy from me. He has acquired a general
notion of Arabian architecture from the great work of Murphy on the
Arabian remains in Spain, and from the splendid and accurate work on the
Alhambra by Messrs. Goury and Jones; and through the kindness of my
friend Mr. Hay, of Linplum, he has been allowed to make a similar use of
a very accurate and very beautiful collection of drawings of a great
number of the finest specimens of Arabian architecture in and around
Cairo, executed by M. Pascal Coste, and now the property of Mr. Hay.[10]
He has also consulted a number of Oriental drawings, and various other
sources. My acknowledgments to other persons I have expressed in several
of the Notes.

"The portion which is comprised in the first volume of this translation,
terminates with part of the hundred and thirty-seventh Night: it is
therefore necessary to remark,--first, that there is less to omit in the
early part of the original work than in the later:--secondly, that the
_Nights_ in the early part are generally much _longer_ than in the
subsequent portion; the first hundred Nights (without the Introduction)
comprising 213 pages in the Cairo edition of the original work; the
second hundred, 149 pages; the third, 107; the fourth, 106; the fifth,
94:[11]--thirdly, that a similar observation applies to the _Notes_
which are inserted in my translation; those appended to the early tales
being necessarily much more copious than the others."


  [1] Two other printed editions were also used by Mr. Lane--that
  of the first two hundred Nights, printed at Calcutta, and in
  consequence of the loss, by shipwreck, of nearly the whole
  impression of the first volume, never completed; and that of
  Breslau. The former differs much, in matter and manner, from
  any other known copy; the latter, which was edited to the close
  of the seven hundred and third night by Professor Habicht, and
  completed by Professor Fleischer, is far inferior to all the
  others. One other edition has appeared in the Arabic, that of
  Calcutta, or "the Calcutta edition of the complete work." It
  was brought from Cairo, and is apparently (though not
  immediately) from the same original as the Boola[k.] edition. I
  have continually referred to it for various readings, without
  finding any one of importance. And here I must animadvert on
  the practice of German orientalists of wasting their own time
  and their readers' patience in collecting such various readings
  of a work like "The Thousand and One Nights" as must
  necessarily be the result of the carelessness or the ignorance
  of copyists and reciters. The habit is unfortunately adopted by
  some Englishmen, who seem to imagine that all that is German is
  therefore learned.--ED.

  [2] "I must here state, that peculiar qualifications are
  required to enable a person to judge of the fidelity of my
  translation. The original work contains many words not
  comprised in any printed dictionary, and a great number of
  words used in senses which no such dictionary gives: in cases
  of both these kinds, I am guided either by the explanations of
  the sheykh Mo[h.]ammad 'Eiyad, or by my having been long in the
  habit of noting down new words during conversation with Arabs,
  and in the perusal of works in which they are explained."

  [3] "As I hope that the copy which he has rendered so valuable
  may be of great utility to many students of the Arabic language
  when I have ceased to profit by it, I may mention here, that
  the few corrections, and some explanations, which I have
  inserted upon the margins of pages will be easily distinguished
  from those of the sheykh Mo[h.]ammad 'Eiyad by the difference
  of our handwritings."

  [4] "When I mention 'my sheykh' in the notes, the sheykh
  Mo[h.]ammad 'Eiyad is the person to whom I allude. In several
  instances, when he has given brief explanations of words,
  phrases, customs, &c., with which I was previously acquainted,
  I have not thought it necessary to name him as my authority in
  notes which I have inserted, though I have sometimes done so."

  [5] "English writers generally express the Arabic vowels and
  diphthongs by their nearest _Italian_ equivalents. This mode is
  very well suited for those who know, and for those who do not
  care for, the correct pronunciation of the words so
  transcribed; but for others I think it objectionable. Our
  language is altogether much more suitable to the purpose of
  expressing the sounds of Arabic than the Italian. Besides, I
  believe it is the custom of every other European nation, in
  transcribing Oriental words, to employ a system congenial with
  its own language. In a former work, I made use of a double h to
  express a very strong Arabic aspirate (as others had done
  before me), and the word 'Hhagg' or 'Hhajj' was pointed out by
  a critic as one remarkably uncouth: Von Hammer, in a review of
  that work, writes the same word (and very properly as a German
  writer) 'Hadschdsch.'"

  [6] "Strictly speaking, it has a sound between that of a in
  'bad' and that of u in 'bud;' sometimes approximating more to
  the former; and sometimes to the latter."

  [7] "Its sound, however, often approximates to that of a in
  'ball.'"

  [8] "Dh is pronounced as th in 'that:' gh represents a guttural
  sound like that produced in gargling: kh represents a guttural
  sound like that which is produced in expelling saliva from the
  throat, and approaching nearer to the sound of [h.] (a very
  strong aspirate) than to that of k: sh is pronounced as in
  'shall:' and th, as in 'thin.'"

  [9] "Es-Suyoo[t.]ee, in his '[H.]osn el-Mo[h.]a[d.]arah,' after
  quoting a description of certain dresses, says, 'As to their
  dresses of honour, and those of the Wezeers and others of
  similar rank, I have struck out the description of them from
  the words of Ibn-Fa[d.]l-Allah; for they are composed of silk
  and gold, which is forbidden by the law, and I have obliged
  myself not to mention in this book any thing of which I should
  be questioned in the world to come, if it be the will of
  God.'--I have never seen any Arabic work with drawings of
  costumes; but Persian drawings are often useful in explaining
  Arab dresses."

  [10] These drawings, with some few exceptions, have now been
  published, from copies in the possession of M. Coste.

  [11] "The substance of the first five chapters in my
  translation, ending with part of the thirty-second Night,
  occupies a hundred and sixty-eight Nights in the edition of
  Breslau."

INTRODUCTION.


_In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful._[i_1]

Praise be to God, the Beneficent King, the Creator of the universe, who
hath raised the heavens without pillars, and spread out the earth as a
bed;[i_2] and blessing and peace be on the lord of apostles, our lord
and our master Mo[h.]ammad, and his Family; blessing and peace, enduring
and constant, unto the day of judgment.

To proceed:--The lives of former generations are a lesson to posterity;
that a man may review the remarkable events which have happened to
others, and be admonished; and may consider the history of people of
preceding ages, and of all that hath befallen them, and be restrained.
Extolled be the perfection of Him who hath thus ordained the history of
former generations to be a lesson to those which follow. Such are the
Tales of a Thousand and One Nights, with their romantic stories and
their fables.

It is related (but God alone is all-knowing,[i_3] as well as all-wise,
and almighty, and all-bountiful,) that there was, in ancient times, a
King[i_4] of the countries of India and China, possessing numerous
troops, and guards, and servants, and domestic dependents: and he had
two sons; one of whom was a man of mature age; and the other, a youth.
Both of these princes were brave horsemen; but especially the elder, who
inherited the kingdom of his father; and governed his subjects with such
justice that the inhabitants of his country and whole empire loved him.
He was called King Shahriyar:[i_5] his younger brother was named
Shah-Zeman,[i_6] and was King of Samar[k.]and.[i_7] The administration
of their governments was conducted with rectitude, each of them ruling
over his subjects with justice during a period of twenty years with the
utmost enjoyment and happiness. After this period, the elder King felt a
strong desire to see his brother, and ordered his Wezeer[i_8] to repair
to him and bring him.

[Illustration]

Having taken the advice of the Wezeer on this subject,[i_9] he
immediately gave orders to prepare handsome presents, such as horses
adorned with gold and costly jewels, and memlooks, and beautiful
virgins, and expensive stuffs.[i_10] He then wrote a letter to his
brother, expressive of his great desire to see him;[i_11] and having
sealed it, and given it to the Wezeer, together with the presents above
mentioned, he ordered the minister to strain his nerves, and tuck up his
skirts, and use all expedition in returning. The Wezeer answered,
without delay, I hear and obey; and forthwith prepared for the journey:
he packed his baggage, removed the burdens, and made ready all his
provisions within three days; and on the fourth day, he took leave of
the King Shahriyar, and went forth towards the deserts and wastes. He
proceeded night and day; and each of the kings under the authority of
King Shahriyar by whose residence he passed came forth to meet
him,[i_12] with costly presents, and gifts of gold and silver, and
entertained him three days;[i_13] after which, on the fourth day, he
accompanied him one day's journey, and took leave of him. Thus he
continued on his way until he drew near to the city of Samar[k.]and,
when he sent forward a messenger to inform King Shah-Zeman of his
approach. The messenger entered the city, inquired the way to the
palace, and, introducing himself to the King, kissed the ground before
him,[i_14] and acquainted him with the approach of his brother's Wezeer;
upon which Shah-Zeman ordered the chief officers of his court, and the
great men of his kingdom, to go forth a day's journey to meet him; and
they did so; and when they met him, they welcomed him, and walked by his
stirrups until they returned to the city. The Wezeer then presented
himself before the King Shah-Zeman, greeted him with a prayer for the
divine assistance in his favour, kissed the ground before him, and
informed him of his brother's desire to see him; after which he handed
to him the letter. The King took it, read it, and understood its
contents;[i_15] and answered by expressing his readiness to obey the
commands of his brother. But, said he (addressing the Wezeer), I will
not go until I have entertained thee three days. Accordingly, he lodged
him in a palace befitting his rank, accommodated his troops in tents,
and appointed them all things requisite in the way of food and drink:
and so they remained three days. On the fourth day, he equipped himself
for the journey, made ready his baggage, and collected together costly
presents suitable to his brother's dignity.

These preparations being completed, he sent forth his tents and camels
and mules and servants and guards, appointed his Wezeer to be governor
of the country during his absence, and set out towards his brother's
dominions. At midnight,[i_16] however, he remembered that he had left in
his palace an article which he should have brought with him; and having
returned to the palace to fetch it, he there beheld his wife sleeping in
his bed, and attended by a male negro slave, who had fallen asleep by
her side. On beholding this scene, the world became black before his
eyes; and he said within himself, If this is the case when I have not
departed from the city, what will be the conduct of this vile woman
while I am sojourning with my brother? He then drew his sword, and slew
them both in the bed: after which he immediately returned, gave orders
for departure, and journeyed to his brother's capital.

Shahriyar, rejoicing at the tidings of his approach, went forth to meet
him, saluted him, and welcomed him with the utmost delight. He then
ordered that the city should be decorated on the occasion,[i_17] and
sat down to entertain his brother with cheerful conversation: but the
mind of King Shah-Zeman was distracted by reflections upon the conduct
of his wife; excessive grief took possession of him; and his countenance
became sallow; and his frame, emaciated. His brother observed his
altered condition, and, imagining that it was occasioned by his absence
from his dominions, abstained from troubling him or asking respecting
the cause, until after the lapse of some days, when at length he said to
him, O my brother, I perceive that thy body is emaciated, and thy
countenance is become sallow. He answered, O brother, I have an internal
sore:--and he informed him not of the conduct of his wife which he had
witnessed. Shahriyar then said, I wish that thou wouldest go out with me
on a hunting excursion; perhaps thy mind might so be diverted:--but he
declined; and Shahriyar went alone to the chase.[i_18]

[Illustration]

Now there were some windows in the King's palace commanding a view of
his garden; and while his brother was looking out from one of these, a
door of the palace was opened, and there came forth from it twenty
females and twenty male black slaves; and the King's wife, who was
distinguished by extraordinary beauty and elegance,[i_19] accompanied
them to a fountain, where they all disrobed themselves, and sat down
together. The King's wife then called out, O Mes'ood![i_20] and
immediately a black slave came to her, and embraced her; she doing the
like. So also did the other slaves and the women; and all of them
continued revelling together until the close of the day. When Shah-Zeman
beheld this spectacle, he said within himself, By Allah! my affliction
is lighter than this! His vexation and grief were alleviated, and he no
longer abstained from sufficient food and drink.

When his brother returned from his excursion, and they had saluted each
other, and King Shahriyar observed his brother Shah-Zeman, that his
colour had returned, that his face had recovered the flush of health,
and that he ate with appetite, after his late abstinence, he was
surprised, and said, O my brother, when I saw thee last, thy countenance
was sallow, and now thy colour hath returned to thee: acquaint me with
thy state.--As to the change of my natural complexion, answered
Shah-Zeman, I will inform thee of its cause; but excuse my explaining to
thee the return of my colour.--First, said Shahriyar, relate to me the
cause of the change of thy proper complexion, and of thy weakness: let
me hear it.--Know then, O my brother, he answered, that when thou
sentest thy Wezeer to me to invite me to thy presence, I prepared myself
for the journey, and when I had gone forth from the city, I remembered
that I had left behind me the jewel that I have given thee; I therefore
returned to my palace for it, and there I found my wife sleeping in my
bed, and attended by a black male slave; and I killed them both, and
came to thee: but my mind was occupied by reflections upon this affair,
and this was the cause of the change of my complexion, and of my
weakness: now, as to the return of my colour, excuse my informing thee
of its cause.--But when his brother heard these words, he said, I
conjure thee by Allah that thou acquaint me with the cause of the return
of thy colour:--so he repeated to him all that he had seen. I would see
this, said Shahriyar, with my own eye.--Then, said Shah-Zeman, give out
that thou art going again to the chase, and conceal thyself here with
me, and thou shalt witness this conduct, and obtain ocular proof of it.

[Illustration]

Shahriyar, upon this, immediately announced that it was his intention to
make another excursion. The troops went out of the city with the tents,
and the King followed them; and after he had reposed awhile in the camp,
he said to his servants, Let no one come in to me:--and he disguised
himself, and returned to his brother in the palace, and sat in one of
the windows overlooking the garden; and when he had been there a short
time, the women and their mistress entered the garden with the black
slaves, and did as his brother had described, continuing so until the
hour of the afternoon-prayer.

When King Shahriyar beheld this occurrence, reason fled from his head,
and he said to his brother Shah-Zeman, Arise, and let us travel whither
we please, and renounce the regal state, until we see whether such a
calamity as this have befallen any other person like unto us; and if
not, our death will be preferable to our life. His brother agreed to his
proposal, and they went out from a private door of the palace
