the harsh voices of the sailors bawling at the ropes would be swept into faint cries by the rush of the wind, and now and again a heavy lumpish sound that put a quiver into every plank, followed by a snarling noise like the hissing of half a dozen locomotives blowing off steam, was warrant enough to ears not unused to such sounds that the ‘Bride’ was taking large doses of water in pretty freely over her rail.\n", "I threw a leg over the yard, steadied the glass against the mast, and instantly witnessed the white canvas of what seemed unquestionably a large schooner-yacht risen to her rail upon the horizon where the thin black length of her swam like an eel with the fluctuations of the refractive atmosphere; but all above was the steady brilliant whiteness of the cloths of the pleasure ship mounting from boom to gaff; a wide and handsome spread with a flight of triangular canvas hovering between jibboom and topmast, as though a flock of seafowl were winging past just there.\n", "Her look of astonishment when I told her that the voice we had heard was a trick of Muffin’s was like a view of her beauty in a new light;

‘there is nothing to make heads or tails of in it that I can see.’ ‘But why?’ and now she stole a sidelong look at me.\n", "I put my lips close to the faint glimmer of her face, and cried ‘Laura, dearest, how is it with you?\n", "And beautiful she was--such a gallant toy as an impassioned sweetheart would love to present to the woman he adored.\n", "I at once rose, bathed, and went on deck, thinking, as I passed through the cabin and observed the brilliant effect of the sunshine streaming through porthole and skylight in rippling silver upon the shining bulkheads, the radiant lamps, the mirrors, rich carpet and elegant draperies of the cabin, what a very insignificant figure a night-fear cuts by daylight.\n", "Every fellow administered his single blow with a will, one or two spitting on their hands before their turn came.\n", "He will obey as Wilfrid orders, and I say, Miss Jennings, with all submission to your engaging, to your beautiful desires as a sister, that if Wilfrid’s humour is going to gain on him at the rate at which I seem to find it growing, it will be my business, as I am certain it will be my duty for everybody’s sake as well as for yours and his own, so to contrive this unparalleled pursuit as to end it swiftly.’ She was silent--a little awed, I think, by my emphatic manner, perhaps by a certain note of sternness, for I had been irritated, besides being nervous; and then, again, my distaste for the trip worked very strongly in me whilst I was talking to her.\n", "‘Now up you go, my lad,’ shouted Cutbill, and the sailor, who was of a light figure, mounted as nimbly as a monkey, hand over hand; three of us holding on to the rope t’other side to secure it for him.\n", "Have you any particulars of the foundering of the “Shark”?’ ‘The yarn her people--I mean the surwivors aboard the barque--spun our men whilst they lay alongside was that they met with a gale of wind, that, after blowing with hurricane fury for two days and two nights, ended in dismasting ’em.\n", "If there be a ghost, as our friend here says, he must promptly be laid by the heels and despatched to the Red Sea.’ ‘What did ’ee want to go and tell Sir Wilfrid about that woice you and Mr. Monson heard t’other night?’ grumbled Finn, as we moved forwards into the darkness towards the forehatch.\n", "They had catted, and were fishing the anchor forwards;

and then, again, there was the great porpoise to get rid of, and, in truth, until one could force an entrance into the craft it mattered little at which end of her one lay.\n", "A day and a night of dead calm followed; they were without food or water, and their outlook was horrible; but at sunrise on the third day they spied the gleam of a sail, towards which they rowed, and before the darkness fell they were safely on board a large English brig bound to Bristol.\n", "‘Enough of it, Mr. Monson, to hold wind to serve a Dutchman for a week, not to mention a torps’l and a t’gallants’l fit for a line-o’-battle ship to ratch under.’ This was vague talk, but it pleased Wilfrid.\n", "‘Finn took your view.\n", "‘_That’s_ what we’ve been awaiting for!’ shouted Finn.\n", "Wilfrid sat at the table with a tumbler of seltzer and brandy before him, and he was filling his large meerschaum pipe as I arrived.\n", "‘Well, mum,’ he bawled, ‘you will do as you like, I suppose, and so must I.

schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen.\n", "Chance puts the Duc d’Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him—thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.\n", "The Preobrazhénsk battalion, breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them.\n", "Come on!...\n", "Anatole was sobbing painfully.\n", "“Discharge me, little mother, for God’s sake!\n", "He sent for an officer.\n", "Fine!\n", "Fóka, the butler, was the most

petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations?\n", "But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one

letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How tell the little countess!” Anna Mikháylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God’s help, would inform her.\n", "“Is it possible?” exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna.\n", "The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to blame.\n", "The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected.\n", "The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by with resolute strides and went into the house.\n", "“Oh!” said he with reproach and surprise, “this is absurd!\n", "The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds went by.\n", "Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.” She rose, put down the

sorry for him!\n", "“She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!” Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more.\n", "She could not fathom whether it was curiosity,

something.\n", "This was Prince Shcherbátov’s house, where Pierre had often been in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckmühl (Davout).\n", "With hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and bound them to the post.\n", "Just then Ferapóntov returned and entered his shop.\n", "But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.\n", "Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Boguchárovo, a man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities.\n", "Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask his deceivers!” And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign, Rostóv pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor.\n", "The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the horses’ feet at the wolf.\n", "Sónya struck the first chord of the prelude.\n", "“Oh, how I will slash at him!” thought Rostóv, gripping the hilt of his saber.\n", "He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs—the “drones” as he called them—and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity.\n", "We know that man has
