Premise:

    Examining consistency of differences in TP returns, for those extracts  that are true smell experiences.

    H0: there's no consistent differnence between TP counts of sets
        i.e.mean of differences = 0 

    H1: set 1 is more likely to correctly identify smell extracts (TP)
        mean of 

    where TP = 1, FP = 0

* limit the signficance test to TP + FP (i.e. extracts that are actual smell experiences)
* convert to numerical form TP = 1, FP = 0 
    i.e.
        extract 1    extract 2
set 1       1            0
set 2       1            1
s 1-2       0           -1

Ho: mean of differences = 0
H1: mean of difference !=0

t =  (mean of diff) - 0 / (s/sqrt(n))

***This is the one selected
single tailed test (set 1 has higher TP count than set 2):
    H0: diff_mean = 0
    H1: diff_mean > 0
   * if 1-cdf < 5%: reject the null

two-tailed test (set 1 and set 2 have a difference TP count):
    H0: diff mean = 0
    H1: diff mean =! 0 

    * if 2*min(1-cdf, cdf) < 5% then reject the null
