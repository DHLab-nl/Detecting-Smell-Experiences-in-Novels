at what cutoffs are the differences in group performance significant

1 vs 2 group performance:
---------------------------
    Ho: diff_mean = 0
    * two-tailed significant:  0.90 - 0.85 - 0.80 - 0.70 - 0
    * one tailed significant: as above

    ? 1 is significantly better at correctly predicting smell extracts 
    However, this is only true in the context of early stopping - NOT USEFUL


[1 and 2 combined] vs 1 group performance:
------------------------------------------
    Ho: diff_mean = 0
    * two-tailed sig: 0.99, 0.95, 0.90, 0.85, 0.80
    * one-tailed sig: as above  , 0.70 

    ? 1 and 2 combined at statistically significantly better at correctly prediciton smell extracts than 1 alone. i.e. diff_mean > 0


[1 and 2 combined] vs ref group performance:
------------------------------------------------
    Ho: diff_mean = 0
    * one-tailed sig: as above  0.99, 0.95, 0.90

    ? 1 and 2 combined are statistically significantly better at correctly identifying smell extracts than the ref group at higher precisions.
