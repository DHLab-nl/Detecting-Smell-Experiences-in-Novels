comparing recall at different cut-off levels
    * there's a consistent difference in recall, is it significant?
    * recall is TP / T, where TP denotes correctly identified extracts

    options:

        1) consider recall as a point proportion statistic (thus CLT) applies, calculate the confidence interval wrt. the point statistic as an estimate of true population recall.
