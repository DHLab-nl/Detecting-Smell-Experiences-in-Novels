the corpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie; Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great hiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the _Gallant Messenger_.</p><p>The stream of city talk from the lips of the two ladies had the merit of being perfect of its kind--softly insinuating and sweetly censorious, superlative in eulogy and infallible in opinion.</p><p>Even the old man he was answering had adopted, to be original in everything, that selfsame conciseness: every sentence of his contained two or three ideas.</p><p><span xml:id="recogito-2b7ab833-b604-49ca-9793-d71313881786" ana="#d">The heavy, sickly sweet odour</span> almost <span xml:id="recogito-f82db841-282e-480f-a4f0-f79fa9a94896" ana="#v">overpowered</span> them, but, grimly set upon their purpose, they, after one moment of hesitancy, crept on.</p><p>I had to shut my eyes at the very remembrance of Miss Fenne's prim and musty drawing-room.</p><p>She dropped herself on the grass beside me, brushing with her dress <span xml:id="recogito-cba86850-28ac-4b4f-aad4-2f16cb2c4611" ana="#d">the scent of wild thyme</span> into the dewy air, and caught my hands in hers.</p><p>But now the novelty of this present experience, the flowery cottages, Mr Waggett's square, sorrel nag, the ballooning northwesterly clouds, <span xml:id="recogito-78fa325d-71c2-4ea9-902f-fef96c7f4380" ana="#d">the aromatic rusty hedgerows</span>, the rooks in the cornfields--all these sights and sounds called joy into my mind, and far too soon the bright-painted railway station at the hill-bottom hove into sight, and our drive was over.</p><p>Who hath not felt that breath in the air, <span xml:id="recogito-516760b5-91ae-4d13-aec0-97a680e9f795" ana="#d">A perfume and freshness strange and rare</span>, A warmth in the light, and a bliss everywhere, When young hearts yearn together?
