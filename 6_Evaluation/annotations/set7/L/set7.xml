AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN In the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripe for commotion.</p><p>Her sojourn in the abbey had been brief and stormy, a curt attempt at discipline that had failed most nobly.</p><p>Diana was there alone sitting by one of the open windows, busy with some work; not so busy but that <span xml:id="recogito-0e1acfa6-3245-40c7-9de6-22c9fff44062" ana="#d">she smelt the roses</span>, and felt the glory of light and colour that was outside, and heard the hum of bees and the twitter of birds and the soft indistinguishable chirrup of insects, which filled the air.</p><p>And then he went into the market and sold one of his jewels, and bought garments and <span xml:id="recogito-01f85874-20ea-4e85-8bf7-8b8dfbcd6742" ana="#d">scented unguents</span>, and also food.</p><p>She had scented danger afar off from that visit.</p><p>The frightened woman dried off the child, brushed his head with <span xml:id="recogito-a695d71f-152f-4013-adf2-a7191f1ec214" ana="#d">perfumed oil</span>, and placed him on a thin pillow of quilted calico for Jadar to see.</p><p>We sate on in <span xml:id="recogito-48c1c24b-ccf6-401e-8eb7-b0d0b9885a66" ana="#d">the sweet, dusty scent of the stormy air.</span></p><p>The air was rich with <span xml:id="recogito-645991e4-a158-4b7e-b97b-2cfeacd030bf" ana="#d">the aroma of roses</span> as servants passed shaking rosewater on the guests from long- necked silver decanters.</p><p>little recks the Royal mind, Within his Banquet Hall, While tapers shine and Music breathes And Beauty leads the Ball,-- He little recks the oaken plank Shall be his palace wall!</p><p>Unlike the rest of London, I gazed at Amenhotep's Mummy in the late dusk of a summer evening; and we had much to say to one another; though but one whiff of the huge round library gave me a violent headache.</p><p>It was the exact calculator who succeeded.</p><p>He told himself that he would go out to find Kumpee, the fetid one, if he only knew where in the big city to search.</p><p>A warm breath of vital energy, an odorous witness-bearing of life fruitfulness, a hum and a murmur of harmonious forces in action, a depth of colour in the light and in the shadow, which told of the richness and fullness of the natural world.</p><p>He rattled the money in his pocket and <span xml:id="recogito-0a0c0f59-7d6b-4405-a0a4-22b42eb0e7ff" ana="#v">breathed</span> t<span xml:id="recogito-a0e3cc90-9b5f-4e2b-9ad0-89cef3ee87c1" ana="#d">he smell of whisky</span> into the tent, peering into it as if he were uncertain whether it was occupied or not.</p><p>And from the wood is <span xml:id="recogito-11914bcc-4519-446e-9211-668759bf81d5" ana="#v">wafted</span> by the wind <span xml:id="recogito-2f1af112-5ee1-40dc-9e1e-1233877fca41" ana="#d">the pungent odour of ripe _pippalis</span>_.</p><p>Large pillows lay strewn about the carpet, and the air hung heavy with <span xml:id="recogito-b657cc87-4235-41ce-b9de-d44f6be039c3" ana="#d">the stale scent of spice</span>.</p><p>Out of his pocket the general produced a letter that <span xml:id="recogito-f85294da-8408-4fee-808b-75fcfa1e1bfb" ana="#d">smelt strongly of a scent King recognized</span>.</p><p>It is the end of it!” Manhood’s <span xml:id="recogito-11b0015e-186c-427a-9f03-e0858ae9b095" ana="#s">conviction and effrontery reeked from his mouth like foul breath and Kazem</span>, who already wanted to wreak havoc on his impudence, flipped him over with the elastic of his underwear like a pancake.</p><p>Her passionate, tumultuous soul seemed to fall into a languorous enervation under <span xml:id="recogito-175a1744-e6a5-4250-97ae-c2504f701387" ana="#d">the fragrance of the orange blossoms</span>.</p><p>His mind was in a tumult of the wildest conjectures, and his thoughts ran to and fro like hounds in a thick brake darting in every direction to find the scent of the game they were in search of.</p><p><span xml:id="recogito-9d44f33c-fc60-4cc7-a744-302b432c432c" ana="#u">She spoke with a languid abandonment; her voice quivering, and tremors rippling across her shoulders, as if all the perfume were hurting her, oppressing her powerful vitality.</span></p><p>She moved closer and <span xml:id="recogito-bffe3347-8cd8-40c5-b4fe-080ea72fe976" ana="#o">her perfume</span> <span xml:id="recogito-d8ee4b03-1f1b-4f7d-9bd8-bb4c487cdbda" ana="#v">enveloped</span> him.</p><p>The <span xml:id="recogito-5e3ee8da-8eea-48d7-b33f-3c45e4520988" ana="#d">fresh milky odor i</span>s quite perceptible, also t<span xml:id="recogito-03b064ce-c8a9-4c3a-8a97-a5c7c1990b22" ana="#d">he perfume of hay from the barn.</span></p><p>She stood reflecting for a few moments, and exclaimed as she laid the bouquet upon the table,-- &quot;Angelique des Meloises, you send your gold and your roses to me because you believe me to be a worse demon than yourself, but you are worthy to be crowned tonight with these roses as queen of hell and mistress of all the witches that ever met in Grand Sabbat at the palace of Galienne, where Satan sits on a throne of gold!&quot;</p><p>Nofre, kneeling before her, fastened on her feet sandals with turned-up ends, <span xml:id="recogito-07673933-e5e4-4949-9ed4-6f3d7a394e4e" ana="#d">cast scented powder on her hair,</span> drew from a box several bracelets in the shape of serpents, and a few rings with sacred scarabaei for gems, put on her cheeks a green powder which immediately turned rose-colour as it touched the skin, polished her nails with a cosmetic, and adjusted the somewhat rumpled folds of her calasiris like a zealous maid who means that her mistress shall show to the greatest advantage.</p><p><span xml:id="recogito-22805003-2db1-48bf-8fc9-189064e7cfe1" ana="#d">Ever the fresh breeze of field, or hill, or lake, is more than any palpitation of fans, though of ivory, and redolent with perfume; and the air is more than the costliest perfumes.</span></p><p>A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued to fortify him in his resolution.</p><p>Meanwhile the hand of the daughter of Petamounoph clung nervously to the edge of the car; her cheeks turned pale under the light touch of rouge which Nofre had put on, and as if she felt herself fainting, she breathed in rapidly and often <span xml:id="recogito-ebc82f76-7e7d-4c2f-908e-330e4ab95626" ana="#d">the scent of her nosegay of lotus.</span></p><p>This cool breeze of a pleasant touch, carrying <span xml:id="recogito-fe15b67b-b01b-42c3-901b-dd8aea7ef319" ana="#d">the fragrance of flowers</span> appears like a fire-brand unto me who am thinking of my spouse.</p><p>The usual delay at the Custom House, the usual soothing of the excited officials in the usual way, and his _arabiyeh_ was jolting Dr. Cairn through the noise and <span xml:id="recogito-480b057a-986b-4ba9-8793-52fc5b63f904" ana="#d">the smell of those rambling streets, a noise and a smell entirely peculiar to this clearing-house of the Near East.</span>
