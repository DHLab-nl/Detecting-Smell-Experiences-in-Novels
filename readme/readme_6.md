# Evaluation of the methodology outcomes

Refer to 6_Evaluation/annotation\ guidelines for the instructions for a copy of the text for annotation and the corresponding annotation instructions.

## Evaluation of the Identification patterns

    i.e., The performance of patterns in identifying smell experiences as tested against a gold standard of manual extract annotations.

### Assembly of the gold standard
* [Assemble a gold standard set of annotated extracts](assemble_annotations.md):
    * [inter-annotator agreement for set0](agreement.md)

### Determine pattern prediction outcomes, pattern precision & recall and produce grouped pattern prediction for a range of precision cut-offs.
* [Determine the prediction outcomes of identification patterns against gold-standard](prediction_outcomes.md) (i.e., TP, FP etc. by sentence, by pattern)
* [Determine the estimated recall and precision statistics, by pattern](pattern_stats.md)

### Significance Tests
Refer to 6_Evaluation/gold_standard/significance_tests for the methodology used to perform significance tests

## Evaluation of pattern performance in targetting lexicon features
